# Project 1
## Real Estate Solution ( Western Suburb Agency )

This project is made for **learning purposes**.
This Web Application has been created to help people find their next home easily
by helping them to navigate and **search for properties** and Real estate agents by entering
minimal data and information such as postcodes.

- **Virtual Support Chat** - This feature includes chat during office house (9am till 6pm) between Guest , Users to Real Estate Agents or Admins. After trade in hours there is an included AutoRobot option that will help and assist you until we come back during office hours next day.

- **Guest** - They can browse the page, without login and signup, they won't be able to change content but they can chat to Real Estate Agents. They have no authority and access to do anything on this  Web Application except to browse the Real Estate properties and look at the different Real Estate Agents.  
- **Users** - In this category comes a landlord who can easily Sign up and Log in by making an account so they can post, view and update their property. They also can talk via virtual support Chat to
Real Estate Agents or Admins.

- **Premium Users** - In this category comes the Real Estate Agents, who are allowed to
Add a Property, Remove a Property and have a look into general Users properties and they can appear and act on
the virtual support chat like Agents so they can help and support general Users or Premium User.
